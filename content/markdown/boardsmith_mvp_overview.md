# Boardsmith MVP - Project Overview

## Vision
Build a clean, intuitive block-based report editor that feels natural and non-technical, inspired by Craft/Notion's user experience. Focus on creating beautiful reports with tables, charts, and embeds, enhanced by AI writing assistance.

## Core Objectives
- **Natural Block Experience**: Feels like writing, not coding
- **Beautiful Reports**: Professional output without design skills
- **AI-Enhanced Writing**: Rewrite, summarize, make concise
- **Mobile + Desktop**: Responsive across all devices
- **Supabase Integration**: Real-time data persistence

## Target User Experience
Users should feel like they're using a premium writing app that happens to have superpowers (blocks, AI, beautiful output) rather than a technical tool that happens to look nice.

## MVP Scope (4-6 weeks)

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript setup
- Supabase integration
- Design system with ShadCN/UI
- Basic block architecture

### Week 3-4: Core Blocks
- Text blocks with rich editing
- Table blocks with data import
- Chart blocks with beautiful visualizations
- Image/embed blocks

### Week 5-6: AI Integration & Polish
- AI writing assistance (rewrite, summarize, etc.)
- Mobile optimization
- Report export functionality
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria
✅ Feels as smooth as Notion/Craft to use
✅ Blocks feel natural, not technical
✅ Beautiful output suitable for business reports
✅ AI assistance enhances rather than complicates
✅ Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
✅ Fast performance with real-time sync

## Key Differentiators
- **Simplicity First**: No overwhelming toolbars or complex menus
- **AI as Thought Partner**: Suggestions, not automation
- **Professional Output**: Business-ready from day one
- **Block Relationships**: Charts connect to table data automatically
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features appear when needed

## Non-Goals for MVP
- ❌ Complex board meeting workflows
- ❌ User roles and permissions
- ❌ Advanced collaboration features
- ❌ Cap table management
- ❌ Meeting scheduling

Focus is purely on the core editing experience and AI enhancement.
